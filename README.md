<p align="justify">
According to the 12th goal under the Sustainable Development Goals, it involves establishing sustainable production and consumption habits, which are essential to maintaining the standard of living for both the present and future generations. It calls for more effective and environmentally responsible management of materials throughout their whole lifecycle, from manufacture to disposal. With DumpsterDash's existence, this would not only serve as a fun application but would also raise awareness of the status of our world today in terms of how sustainability and correct segregation of waste is being handled. Since the majority of people play video games on their devices, this game would be helpful in spreading awareness of the 12th Sustainable Development Goal as it would be accessible to practically all age groups and almost anyone with a gadget would be able to play this game!

<p align="justify">
For our food and means of subsistence, human existence depends just as much on the ground as it does the ocean. Eighty percent of the human diet is made up of plants, and agriculture is a significant source of income for us. Providing habitat for millions of species, significant sources of clean air and water, and being essential for preventing climate change, forests encompass 30% of the Earth's surface. And trash, or improper rubbish segregation, is one of the elements that ruins animal habitats. Because when we scatter our rubbish around, some little creatures end up eating it and becoming ill or occasionally even perish. Our program is in line with this objective since we want to educate people about the value of segregation and how to accomplish it, as well as the effects that waste we simply put into the environment can have.

## Overview of Dumpster Dash and the Program

<p align="justify">
Dumpster Dash is a 2D side-scrolling game built with Python and Pygame where players control Wally Waste, sorting trash into correct bins (biodegradable/non-biodegradable) while running through DumpVania. The enhanced version includes Firebase integration for global leaderboards and real-time score tracking.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The game implements several core classes: The "Runner" class handles Wally's movement and animations, while "Bio" and "NonBio" variants manage the different bin mechanics. For trash objects, specialized "Garbage", "BioGarbage", and "NonBioGarbage" classes control spawning behavior with randomized lane and type selection.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Game flow is managed through three main states: The "MainMenu" state handles UI navigation and Firebase authentication, the "Game" state processes core gameplay with automatic score submission, and the "GameOver" state displays both personal bests and global leaderboards. The game loop efficiently handles input processing, collision detection, and background scrolling while maintaining seamless Firebase connectivity.
